## About Myself:

I graduated with a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence from Northeastern University in December 2023. Over the year of 2023, I was working as a Teaching and Research Assitance in Northeastern University for several monthes. The research project I participated in encompassed several topics, including diffusion models, optimization of transformer-based models, and multi-task fine-tuning across multiple datasets. I am confident in building Deep learning projects from scratch and have a fair understanding of how to customize them based on the different requirements of the project. I also have hands-on experience with the AWS platform, specifically in training, tuning, and deploying machine learning models.


## Current Status

- Actively looking for full-time position related to data science, Machine learning and related field.

- Currently learning AWS and Spark to understand the industry-level deployment of AI technology. Some hands-on projects is updating on githup repository.
